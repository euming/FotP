Architecture questions
- Is a Dieability any different than a TileAbility? Should we separate them into different classes?

High Priority
- Double check herder rules: Claim on any die. Roll 1 die if at least a locked pair on that roll.
x Show numbers of scarabs
x implement quit/pause game.
x implement herder tile
? bug fix: nTiles wrong for non-red tiles
x bug fix: infinite dice on click of set dice tile
- Make a list of the texture sheets that I need.
- Dice Physics seems broken when rolling dice with the boards moving
x Make a generic ability power that includes the UI state machine. 
  x Retrofit scarab abilities.
x Game state triggers to enable certain tiles to be played.
x Should instantiate/clone tiles rather than use the actual tile
x Can only reroll active dice.
  x Make sure the flow works when not-active dice are chosen and rejected.
- Networking play!
- Choose number of players. Needs UI and code.
- Implement roll-off for pharaoh
  - When the queen is claimed, that player claims the pharaoh token and announces his roll to the other players, placing 1 die
	in the appropriate numbered die in the pyramid (UI thing).
	Any players who did not get a turn this round (right of start player and left of Queen claimant) gets 1 die token.
	- Automatically skip players who cannot win due to not enough dice.
	Queen gets one last chance to claim the Pharoah if someone has claimed him. Then the game ends.
	
  

Bugs:
- Moving pips between dice does not work with serf die
- Indentured Servant is getting scarabs on beginning of turn.
- Green intrigue die should have no value when 6** is locked.
- Adjust Die tile allows you to adjust a new die without finishing the old one.
? Head Servant may only work on immediate dice.
- Artisan add pips on a die should end when clicking on the tile a second time.
- Player should not be able to claim a card after already claiming a card with the existing roll.
- Palace key gets 2 dice, but displays only 1 moved to cup
x Player must lock a die before being able to roll again.
x Sometime allows you to roll dice without having locked a die.
x Allows you to lock a die and then unlock a die and then roll again. Should not allow you to go to next phase if you undo a locked die and have no locked dice for the phase.
x Incorrectly deciding that all dice have settled.
x pass turn is broken
x Some tiles are upside-down. Make sure the TileSlot forces orientation.
x rolling single die is buggy due to requirement that all dice are rolled for physics and shit
x Only check locked dice for criteria. (Maybe: Automatically lock other dice after initial check.)
- AddPips doesn't work with custom dice
x Locked dice from previous rolls should not be able to be rerolled
x iTween creates 2 extra components after ending play of editor.
x White dice are no longer white
x White dice auto lock without being rolled.
x White dice scaled improperly after fresh roll. Need slot in DiceCup to reset all the scales and stuff.
x You can return a tile after purchasing it.
x Walls are removed before die finishes settling
- No physics on first dice throw sometimes. (When we pull down the purchaseBoard)
x Do not allow newly purchased dice to be put into active die area.
x Don't allow player to click the dice before the dice have stopped rolling.
  x Don't allow dice purchase before rolling.
x Should have a number of tiles appropriate to the number of players

UI:
- When Artisan Die rolled a 1, change tile to be able to click and change other die rolls.
x Hover hint text
- Get UI to work with any resolution.
x Tile Ability bar to show all Tiles
  x Arrange Tile Ability bar sensibly as a player UI
  - Slide slide-outs left/right up/down.
- Darken out Tiles that are not available anymore.
x Purchase board should allow us to buy tiles easily.
  x Place tiles in slots correctly oriented.
x Blue tiles
x Red tiles
x Automatically move purchase board when rolling
x Automatically open purchase board when done rolling
x Print out status messages
x Show scarabs. Allow scarab use
- Automatically close other tiles if opening one.
x hover for tooltip on tiles
  - put tooltips in a more attractive UI text box.
- Other players
- Herder tile
  - The Herder tile may be claimed by any locked dice. However, it is possible on future turns to not be able to claim any tile.
    If that happens, claim 2 scarab tokens instead.
	
- Use touch interface to be able to swipe info screens from sides of the board.
- Open PurchaseBoard to highest row that may be purchased.
- Implement Pharoah token which sits on the Queen.
- Show locked dice in a pyramid like in the regular game. Rotate in 3D 90 degrees to show the pyramid!

Lower Priority

- Start player tile
- Start tile
- Player warning when white dice were not specifically locked?
